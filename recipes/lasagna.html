            Lasagna is an Italian baked pasta dish made with layers of flat pasta sheets, sauce (typically a tomato-based ragù and/or béchamel), cheese (often mozzarella and Parmesan), and sometimes meat or vegetables. The layers are stacked and baked until the pasta is tender and the top is golden and bubbling. Traditional versions come from regions like Emilia-Romagna (lasagna alla bolognese) and Naples (lasagna di carnevale). The dish has many regional and family variations throughout Italy and internationally.
